  <h1>Food</h1>

  <p> Food plays a big weight on our carbon footprint. According to The World Bank and IFC’s report Livestock and Climate Change, 50% of the man-produced carbon footprint comes from meat, dairy and egg farming. Besides, housing, transporting, and transforming food add up several CO2 emissions as well. And if this was not enough, the world is now facing water shortage in some part of the world, that, if not regulated, can cause several damages.<br><br>

    To avoid that, we can already individually pay attention to these different components of our food supply:
  </p>

  <h2>Animal products</h2>
  <ul>
    <div data-aos="fade-right">
    <h3><i class="fas fa-drumstick-bite"></i> Reduce meat consumption</h3> <br>
    <img class="eggs" src="img/food/alison-marras-vZB-q_0_xQE-unsplash.jpg" alt="box of eggs">
    <li>Meat is very controverted since it needs water. According to Foodtank, to produce one beef (approx. 540 kg or 1200 pounds) 2 158 800 gallons of water are necessary (over 8 171 946 liters).

       For pork (295 kg or 650 pounds), 374 400 gallons of water (1 417 258 liters) are required. To compare, soybeans use 216 gallons (817 liters) and corn 108 gallons (408 liters) to produce. You can compare different products <a target="_blank" href="https://waterfootprint.org/en/resources/interactive-tools/product-gallery/">here</a>. <br><br>

      <li>  In addition, as seen in the <a href="causes-and-risks.php">causes and risks of climate breakdown section</a>, animal husbandry, and especially cows, reject methane (through burps and gases), which are harmful for the greenhouse effect.</li></li> <br>
      <li>Moreover, animals need food, which could be saved to feed humans. They are also using land that could be used to harvest vegetables and legumes for humans. the PETA NGO (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) proved that "It takes about 13 pounds of grain to produce a single pound of meat. All that grain would go a long way toward feeding the hundreds of millions of people—many of them children—who don’t have enough to eat."</li><br>
      <li>Finally, animals are fed to gain mass in a minimum of time. This is not natural, and they are often fed with hormones to enhance this growth alongside with antibiotics to protect them from possible bacteria. By eating this food, you are ingesting growth hormone as well as these antibiotics, which can make you antibiotic-resistant and lead to important health problems.</li>

      <h3><i class="fas fa-blender"></i> Avoid Dairy products</h2><br>
        <img class="dairy" src="img/food/christina-branco-7P-wc2Z2Ujs-unsplash.jpg" alt="cookies and milk">
        <li>Creams and cheese are derivated of milk. Milk, as well as meat is made with the hormones and antibiotics given to cows, which can result in the same health issues. </li> <br>
        <li>Moreover, milk is made by cows for their babies. By being the only living animals drinking someone else's milk, we separate a baby from his mom and we are drinking a beverage that is supposed to make us triple our original weight.</li>

      </ul>
      <br><br>
      <ul>
          <div data-aos="fade-right">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-egg"></i> Eggs</h3><br>
        <li>This one is less obvious but, according to the SINC (Spanish "Servicio de Información y Noticias Científicas"), 68 million tons of eggs are produced worldwide. This lead to chicken farms who are close to each other, don't have enough space to move and live between feces, dead other chickens and bacteria, which "generates negative effects on the environment, including the emission of greenhouse gases and the contamination of soil and water."</li><br>
        <li>However, it is okay to eat either organic or free-range eggs, from chickens who can roam freely outdoors, which enhance the quality of the eggs while restricting the footprint.</li>
              </div>
      </ul>

<h2>Buy quality food</h2>

      <ul>
          <div data-aos="fade-right">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-shopping-basket"></i> Shop locally and from season</h3> <br>
        <li>Shopping locally allows you to save local employments as well as CO2 expenses, because the food and goods you purchase are seasonal, made locally in your neighborhood and did not flew from the other side of the world (like strawberries in the middle of winter).</li> <br>
        <li>If you buy food that is from the other side of the world, try to buy fair trade productions, more respectful of the farmers and the environment, rather than huge farming factories.</li>
            </div>
      </ul>
<br>
      <ul>
          <div data-aos="fade-right">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-carrot"></i> Try to buy organic food as much as possible</h3>
        <li>First, for your health: pesticides are not natural and has been proven by the farmers who died of cancer that these products are toxic and carcirogenic, so so it is better to stay away from non organic food (fruits, vegetables, meat, fish...). <a href="img/food/dirty-dozen.png"target="_blank">Here</a>, you can see the famous "clean 10 and dirty dozen" for food highly (or not) treated.</li><br>
        <li>Then, for the environment: according to the US National Library of Medicine,  "Pesticides can contaminate soil, water, turf, and other vegetation. In addition to killing insects or weeds, pesticides can be toxic to a host of other organisms including birds, fish, beneficial insects, and non-target plants."</li>

        <h3><i class="fas fa-hamburger"></i> Avoid any processed food</h3><br>
        <img class="organic" src="img/food/neonbrand-sEwtU-qy06c-unsplash.jpg" alt="organic market">
        <li>There's a common saying "if it doesn't look like something you know, do not eat it". Processed food is not good for your health, nor for the environment.</li><br>
        <li>For your health first, because it contains toxins and non-natural substances such as "dyes" or "preservatives", too much saturated fat, or salt, which is harmful to your health in the long run, since it can cause obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancers and cardiovascular diseases. </li><br>
        <li>Then for the environment, because it is produced in factories that contribute to the greenhouse effect by engendering the global footprint.</li><br>
        <li>Instead, eat a lot of grains, legumes, and vegetable, it will benefit your health as well as the environment.</li>

      <h2>Water</h2>

        <h3><i class="fas fa-tint"></i> Use water consciously</h3><br>

        <li>And last but unfortunately not least, water consumption is not endless, and some countries in 2019 are already in water deficit and at high risk to have no water getting out of their tap.</li><br>
        <li>Therefore, some countries, including Qatar, Israel, Lebanon, Iran, Jordan, Lybia, Koweit, Saudi Arabia, The Eritrea, the emirates, San Marin, Bahrein, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Oman, Botswana and India are now living under the scarcity threshold, because the water resource is used at 80% for farming, factories, and cities purposes.</li><br>
        <li>Moreover, since the world is facing more and more heatwaves, episodes of dryness are going to emphasis this shortage, which will eventually lead to food and financial insecurities, conflicts and immigrations.</li><br>
        <li>Finally, if nothing is done, the United Nations Organization predicts the global water deficit will be around 40% by 2030. It is therefore important to use water consciously to keep the entire world thirst and hunger satiated.</li>
