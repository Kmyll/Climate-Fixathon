  <h2>1990 - Second World Climate Conference</h2>
  <p>
  The second World Climate Conference was again hold in Geneva. The first report of the IPCC has reported alarming signs of climate change. However, the debate was more political than the first one and did not lead to main, impacting changes and measures since aims could be implemented on a voluntary basis. <br><br>

  However, two units were created, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, part of the Kyoto Protocol) and the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).

  <h2>SEMANA DIEZ</h2>
  <p>
	  Recibimos una autoevaluación del profe, la cual no me esperaba porque ya tenía este portafolio y este capítulo 10 no existía, no estaba en el guión, salió del presupuesto. 😂😂

	<p>No tuve dudas de la clase.</p>
