	<p>
	Since the 70', Countries, States, and Governments realized they had to agree on new laws, regulations and efforts to protect the climate, and started to meet to find practical solutions to protect populations and to prevent climate breakdown. Although a lot of meetings occurred since, here is an overview of the main climate agreements between nations.</p>

  The second World Climate Conference was again held in Geneva. The first report of the IPCC has reported alarming signs of climate change. However, the debate was more political than the first one and did not lead to main, impacting changes and measures since the decisions debated and adopted, could be implemented voluntarily. <br><br>

  However, two units were created:<br><br>  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)</li>
    <li>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which created the yearly "COP" conferences regarding climate. The "Parties" mentioned below are the countries who signed this convention (195 countries plus the European Union). Its goals are to look at what has been done regarding previous negotiations and decide to take further actions and implement them.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Agreement on the Climate Change Convention (which led to the Kyoto Protocol)</li>
  <li>Protect First Nation's land against environmental or cultural degradations</li>
  <li>Signature of the Convention of Biological Diversity</li>

  <h2>1997 - Kyoto Protocol</h2>
  <p><br>
    Unlike the second WCC, the Kyoto Protocol contains concrete and mandatory objectives for the country who signed it. It targets the reduction of the 6 greenhouse gas, including Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrous oxide, Hydrofluorocarbons, Perfluorocarbons, and Sulphur Hexafluoride. <br><br>
    It is a universal protocol in which the objective is for all developed countries to reduce their carbon footprint by 5%. The protocol expired in 2012 and resulted in mixed success.

  <h2>2019 - GIEC Climat Summit</h2>
  <p><br>
    The GIEC experts have warned in 2018 that some concrete actions must be taken to limit a rise in temperatures below 1.5 degrees. They expect an increase of 3 degrees by the end of the century, which is more than what governments agreed in Paris during the COP 21 (to keep temperature rise below 2 degrees). This meeting held in Geneva focused on soils and its effects caused by Global warming, deforestation and agriculture. According to their findings and reports, 1/4 of the emerged lands have been deteriorated by humans use. Moreover, lands and cities are warming up twice as much as the rest of the planet. Finally, Global warming is slowing down global agricultural production.<br>  </p>
