<h1>About </h1>

<p>Hello, I am Camille, I am a developer based in Paris, France, and I made this website in order <a href="causes-and-risks.php">to raise awareness regarding climate breakdown</a> as well as
giving practical advice to reduce our carbon footprint, while <a href="food.php">eating</a>,<a href="transports.php">commuting</a> and in our daily <a href="lifestyle.php">lifestyle</a>.
<br><br>

Every single day, we hear things about the climate in the news. Here is a sample of what I collected for August only:</p>
<br>
<img class="about-pic" src="img/transports/fabrizio-borni-naCeXMuJyJI-unsplash.jpg" alt="bicycles">
<ul class="about-ul">
<li>"Brazil goes into action against fires in the Amazon"</li>
<li>"Humanity is exhausting the land" </li>
<li>"11 billion tons of ice melted in one day in Greenland" </li>
<li>"Brazil: the Institute director whom was disclosing deforestation data was dismissed"</li>
<li>"Climate experts look at the crucial role of land" </li>
<li>"Pollution: the "shame of taking the plane" plagues the air transport"</li>
<li>"Ethiopia announces planting 350 million trees in one day" </li>
<li>"Brazil: as promised, Bolsonaro accelerates deforestation in the Amazon" </li>
<li>"40,000 liters of oil dumped in the purest waters of the planet" </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>By talking about Climate, journalists enhance the gravity of the situation, as well as the ineffective actions took by governments to apply concrete laws. The main issues with States are that Climate breakdown and the worldwide economy doesn't work altogether, and the Heads of States prefer to privilege the economy, to avoid instability, famines, and wars. But a stable economy will not save the Earth, money won't buy another planet and if we do not do anything, we will be soon suffocating and missing oxygen to breathe and live in warming countries. We do not have to change all our lifestyle in a day if everybody does some small, effective changes, step by step and one by one, we can enhance the Earth's health and slow down the climate downfall.</p>
<br>
<p>Therefore, I created this website because I could not find anything online that lists all the causes of Global warming, and without knowing the causes, we cannot take actions to remedy to it.</p>
<br><br>
<p class="about-cta">I hope you have a nice visit on this website and you take 2-3 ideas to change your lifestyle to slow down your carbon footprint. We all have a role to play in here, we're all in this together, let's do it!</p>
